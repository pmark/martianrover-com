# To do next

- Integrate voice-change-o-matic code in order to visualize audio input frequency bars.
- Viz: vertical sound frequency bar showing active, steady sound input centered around 417 hz

# Then

- 3D spiral
- get sound frequency
- plot frequency specturm
- plot dominant frequency samples over time while active
- send frequency to server periodically and ends
